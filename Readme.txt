I made some changes to the script.     (Updated to work with the latest WIndows 11 22h2 Beta)
1. I added the ability to install the latest security patch from script which can be downloaded from the update catalog site you can get the latest KB from the latest windows 11 update history site.

2. You must install Startisallback, this is a trial but a few dollars is way better than paying hundreds for a OS that spies on you due to it breaking the stock UI but works well, use the following setting to get the best out of 11.
-Welcome select Kinda 10 -Start Menu default from drop down.
-Taskbar default from drop down. This will fix the 11 UI as well as bring back the ability to change audio setting from taskbar the network tab doesn't work but 11 settings suck anyways.
-This script gives you the ability to install Dolby Atmos automatically most may not need but maybe helpful if you have a TV or surround sound to support it to enable it right click the sound icon from taskbar highlight sound setup and choose Dolby Atmos and you should see Dolby Atmos on you your TV info. There maybe minor bugs but works well for the most part. If you have to mute and unmute to get audio working for instance watching youtube try updating your TV's firmware fixed on my LG CX TV.

3. The Linux script has changed to 11.sh at the end of the script it will ask if you want to restore clipsvc.dll which you require for Dolby Atmos app but just do ctrl-c to cancel if you didn't install it.
